# Overview
This data science project aims to analyze sleep using the sleep data.
# Project Structure
The project is structured as follows:

data directory: This directory contains the raw data used in the analysis.
notebooks directory: This directory contains Jupyter notebooks that were used to perform the data analysis.
reports directory: This directory contains the final report summarizing the findings of the analysis.
src directory: This directory contains any source code used in the analysis.
# Data
The data used in this project is stored in the data directory. The dataset was sleep data and consists of sleep data. The dataset was collected from kaggle and modified by changing the rows.

#Notebooks
The notebooks directory contains several Jupyter notebooks used in the analysis. The notebooks are numbered in the order they were executed, and include:

01_data_wrangling.ipynb: This notebook outlines the data cleaning process, including handling missing data and transforming variables.
02_exploratory_data_analysis.ipynb: This notebook contains the exploratory data analysis, including descriptive statistics, visualizations, and any hypothesis testing.
03_model_building.ipynb: This notebook details the model building process, including feature selection, hyperparameter tuning, and model evaluation.
Reports
The reports directory contains the final report summarizing the findings of the analysis. The report includes an executive summary, methodology, key findings, and any conclusions or recommendations based on the analysis.

# Source Code
